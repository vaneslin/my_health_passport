## Development

### app_page param

For development purposes, the current screen shown within the mock phone can be changed using the `app_page` url parameter.

Example: setting the url to:

```
index.html?app_page=example.html
```

will load the `app/example.html` page in the mock phone.

This allows multiple team members to work on different app pages, without needing to modify the environment page.
